# The Curse of AstaroK

A push your luck Dungeon Crawl game where you need to release your town from the curse of AztaroK
<br/>

# Background

The evil Astarok has cast a nasty curse on the folk of Griford and turned them into pumpkins! The town's people have asked you to battle the AstaroK and his evil friends in their hideout - an old castle on the edge of town.

You need to fight your way in the dark castle of the evil AstaroK, by casting runes that will release different powers depending on the combinations cast. You start with a limited arsenal of skills but will be able to acquire more advanced skills with the SP (Skill Points) that you gain by winning battles in the dark castle. You may also win gold too if you are lucky! When you win a battle, you can continue further into the dungeon or head back to town to buy more supplies with your winnings.

Be careful, if you are defeated in a battle you will be warp back to town but with half of the SP that you gained during the game. You will also forfeit a helmet or potion as punishment.

Purchasing a rune with Skill Points will unlock that combination and make it available within a fight. If you cast the combination, the special powers are released.

<br/>

The Rune Shop is entered by pressing the Up button while standing in front of the door (**Fig 1**). As with the Item Shop, runes can be reviewed and purchased using the Up / Down buttons and the A button. Each rune combination shows the combination's name, the damage it inflicts and the purchase price (in SP on the right) (**Fig 2 - 5**). The rune combinations themselves are shown with special characters &ne; and ? indicating that the runes should not equal each other or the rune value can be any value, respectively. Purchased runes can be views in your inventory (**Fig 6**).

The rune combination and details are listed below:

<br/>

<table>
<tr><td>Item</td><td>Cost</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Description</td></tr>
<tr><td>Fire&nbsp;Blaze</td><td>30&nbsp;SP</td><td><ul><li>20 damage points applied immediately</li><li>5 additional damage points applied to the next two casts for Skeletons, Werewolves and Astarok </li><li>10 additional damage points applied to the next two casts for Gelatinous Cubes.</ul></td></tr>
<tr><td>Healing&nbsp;Wind&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>25&nbsp;SP</td><td><ul><li>20 HP points applied immediately</li></ul></td></tr>
<tr><td>Rising&nbsp;Star</td><td>35&nbsp;SP</td><td><ul><li>35 damage points applied immediately</li></ul></td></tr>
<tr><td>Venom&nbsp;Mist</td><td>35&nbsp;SP</td><td><ul><li>20 damage points applied immediately for Skeletons, Werewolves, Gelatinous Cubes and Astarok </li><li>2 additional damage points applied to the next two casts for Gelatinous Cubes, Small Werewolves and Astarok.</li><li>4 additional damage points that are applied to the next two casts for the Large Werewolf only.</li><li>The Venom Mist does not affect the Skeleton.</li></ul></td></tr>
</table>

Notes:

* For rune combinations that apply damage on subsequent casts, the additional damage points are forfeited if you do not cast a scoring sequence in the next cast(s).

* You can only purchase a rune combination once. Its power remains with you when used and even if you die.

* Rune combinations do not need to be cast in the exact sequence listed however must contain the exact tiles. In the Venom Mist, all tiles must be different. In the Fire Blaze combination, you must throw the two pairs shown - the remaining rune can be another of the same runes (thus making a Full House) or a different rune altogether.

<br/>

You may enter the dungeon at any time, with or without supplies you may have bought from the store. Upon entering the castle, you will encounter an enemy with minimal DEF and HP but as you progress further down into the labyrinth of dungeons the enemies will become stronger.

An enemy may attack you as you enter a dungeon before you have a chance to attack first (**Fig 4**). When it is your turn to attack you cast the runes by pressing the 'A' button. Once they have rolled to a stop you can choose to keep some and recast the remainder by jumping and touching those you wish to recast. Once all of the runes to recast have been selected, press the 'A' button to recast the selected rune. You can typically recast up to 3 times however if you have consumed a 'Speed Potion' you can increase this for the current attack.

If you cast a rune combination that matches one of the runes sets purchased from the town or you cast a combination from the 'standard' set below, you may skip a recast by not selecting any runes to recast and simply pressing the 'A' button.

If a scoring rune combination is cast, the damage is inflicted on the enemy immediately (**Fig 1 and 2**). This may be followed by a secondary damage caused by a Fire Blaze or Venom Mist rune as these have a residual effect that lasts over two subsequent attacks (**Fig 3**).

<br/>

<table>
<tr><td>Combination&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>Attack Points Inflicted</td></tr>
<tr><td>Two&nbsp;Pair</td><td>10</td></tr>
<tr><td>Three&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Kind</td><td>20</td></tr>
<tr><td>Full&nbsp;House</td><td>25</td></tr>
<tr><td>Four&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Kind</td><td>30</td></tr>
<tr><td>Five&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Kind</td><td>45</td></tr>
</table>

<br/>

At any time when it is your turn to attack, you can access you inventory and put on a helmet or drink a potion.

<br/>

## Rewards <a name="rewards"></a>

[Top](#top)

After successfully defeating an enemy your will be rewarded immediately with some SP - the amount is random and will typically increase as you delve deeper into the dungeons below the castle. Occasionally, you will be rewarded with GP while still in the dungeon and, again, the amount is both random and will increase as you fight stronger and stronger enemies.

![Astarok_HP_01|256x128](upload://6c4EqWypTSgWzpe3kxoK1kWzBTY.png)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![Astarok_HP_02|256x128](upload://pFndzgKqeEE2siuhj09XZAFLYor.png)

<br/>

You may also be rewarded randomly with some HP but these are placed in the village for you to discover. However, you must leave the dungeon to find the HP which will result in you having to re-enter the dungeons at level one and fight the same enemies again.
